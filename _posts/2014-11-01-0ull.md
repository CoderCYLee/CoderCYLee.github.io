## 0ull

```c
// 0uLL：unsigned long long 类型的0
// ~：“二进制 按位 否 运算符”
// >>：右移运算符
// <<: 左移运算符
```

```objective-c
/*!
 * @typedef dispatch_time_t
 *
 * @abstract
 * A somewhat abstract representation of time; where zero means "now" and
 * DISPATCH_TIME_FOREVER means "infinity" and every value in between is an
 * opaque encoding.
 */
typedef uint64_t dispatch_time_t;

#define DISPATCH_TIME_NOW (0ull)
#define DISPATCH_TIME_FOREVER (~0ull)
