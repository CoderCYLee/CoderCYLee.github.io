## 苹果的解释

Thank you for the resubmission. Your app name to be displayed on the App Store includes keywords or descriptors, which are not appropriate for use in an app name.

Specifically, the following words in your app name are considered keywords or descriptors:

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx


Next Steps

Please revise your app name to remove any keywords and descriptors from all localizations of your app. Keywords can be entered in the Keywords field in iTunes Connect to be used as search terms for your app.

Please also remember to re-evaluate your app name title to ensure it’s 50 characters or less.

Resources

For information on how to revise your app name, please see Renaming a Project or App.

For information on changing the app name and other metadata in iTunes Connect, please see the section, "Viewing and Changing Your App's Metadata", in the iTunes Connect Developer Guide.



## 解决办法

### ~~1.把现有的描述和关键字都删掉~~

~~失败，依旧被拒。~~

### ~~2.回复，邮件，电话~~

~~尝试中，等结果。~~

### 找到问题了

seo优化，搞了好多个本地化，每个名字不一样，其中一个出了问题。删除或修改出问题的文字，即可解决。
